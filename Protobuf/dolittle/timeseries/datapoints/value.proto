/*
Represents a value.

A value consist of the following:

** TYPE ** 
Type is the actual type, such as a primitive; float, int32, int64 - or a more complex type.
This says what to expect in the content property and is important for the serialization.

** ORIGIN **
Origin represents the actual origin that generated the value. It is an integer that is meant to
be used as a lookup for resolving its actual origin.

** UNIT **
Unit is based on the internal System of Units (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units).
This indicate what to expect as unit for the content.

** CONTENT **
Content is the actual protobuf serialized binary of the content based on the type.
